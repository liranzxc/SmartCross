# SmartCross

pipeline  multiprocess python programming divide by three parts :
* Fetch from cameras - N process
* Decode model - 1 Process (queue requests), YOLO object Detection
* Decision model

3 stage in the pipeline for the high performance run on GPU (CUDA)

* Also Arduino system and sensor on light traffic for changes signals.
